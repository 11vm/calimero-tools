		Contains a collection of Calimero tools for KNX network communication. Each tool provides 
		a ready-to-use functionality of the Calimero-core library on the terminal.
		<p>
		A tool offers a particular feature of the Calimero library. It aims to help
		in getting familiar with the library, and interact with the offered library API.
		Tool implementations are terminal-based, i.e., they are 
		intended to run in a terminal or command line window.
		<p>
		To check out the implementation and control flow of a tool, a good point 
		to start is the <code>main</code>-method of that tool. 
		<p>
		Access to the KNX network is supported using KNXnet/IP tunneling or routing over an 
		IP network connection, using FT1.2 or TP-UART over a serial port connection.
		<p>
		KNXnet/IP address considerations:<br>
		On more than one IP address assigned to the local host, and possibly several local network 
		interfaces available (also known as multi-homed hosts), the default chosen local host 
		might not be the one expected by the user. In that situation, the local IP
		address has to be supplied manually, using command line options.<br>  
		The KNXnet/IP protocol expects IPv4 addresses by default.<br> 
		Network Address Translation (NAT) aware communication can only be used, 
		if the remote KNXnet/IP server supports it. 
		Otherwise, connection timeouts will occur. With NAT enabled, 
		KNXnet/IP also works with IPv6 addresses.
